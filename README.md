# Warband-Corpse-Limit-Patcher
A simple patch for Mount and Blade: Warband, to allow up to 999 corpses!

This patch is designed to modify the 'mb_warband.exe' file in your Warband game installation. When you apply this patch, it automatically creates a backup of the original 'mb_warband.exe' file, renaming it to 'mb_warband.exe.bak'. This backup is stored in the same folder as your Warband installation, ensuring you have a way to revert any changes made by the patch.

If at any point you wish to adjust the settings related to the maximum corpse amount in the game (you can still lower it in the options!), you'll need to first restore the original 'mb_warband.exe' file. To do this, delete the modified 'mb_warband.exe' file currently in your Warband installation folder. Then, rename the backup file from 'mb_warband.exe.bak' to 'mb_warband.exe'. This restores the original game file, allowing you to re-apply the patch with different settings if desired.
